# hackerrank

This repository holds solutions for problems from HackerRank(https://www.hackerrank.com). It's used for practicing things.

Since HackerRank does not allow us to submit multiple java files for a solution, all solution should not depend on any other classes (except those provided by JDK). As a result, all solutoins are independent. Therefore, you may find many codes are duplicated among solutions.
